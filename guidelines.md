### Detailed Feedback:

#### 1. Code Correctness and Logic
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/auth/UserService.java` (Line 45):**
  - **Comment:** The `if (user == null)` check is vital, but the subsequent `user.getEmail()` access *before* the null check ensures `user` is not null would lead to a `NullPointerException` if `user` is indeed null. The order of checks should be `user == null` first.
  - **Suggestion:**
    ```java
    public User registerUser(User user) {
        if (user == null) {
            logger.warn("Attempted to register a null user object.");
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("User object cannot be null.");
        }
        // Now 'user' is guaranteed not to be null
        if (user.getEmail() == null || user.getEmail().isEmpty() || !isValidEmail(user.getEmail())) {
            logger.warn("Invalid email provided for registration: {}", user.getEmail());
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid email format or empty email.");
        }
        // ... rest of logic
    }
    ```
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/auth/LoginService.java` (Line 78):**
  - **Comment:** The logic for password verification uses `String.equals()` directly after retrieval from the database. While the password should be hashed, if it's retrieved as a string, `String.equals()` is prone to timing attacks. Consider using `MessageDigest.isEqual()` or a library-specific constant-time comparison.
  - **Suggestion:** Ensure password comparison is done in a constant-time manner. If using Spring Security, leverage `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.

#### 2. Code Quality and Readability
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/auth/UserService.java` (Line 20):**
  - **Comment:** The logger instance `logger` should ideally be declared `private static final` to ensure it's initialized once per class and is accessible without object instantiation, which is a standard and more efficient practice for loggers.
  - **Suggestion:**
    ```java
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);
    ```

#### 3. Performance and Efficiency
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/auth/AuditService.java` (Line 110):**
  - **Comment:** The `saveAuditLog` method performs a database insert within a loop that iterates over a list of events. This can lead to an N+1 query problem, significantly impacting performance for large lists of audit events.
  - **Suggestion:** Implement batch insertion for audit logs. Most JPA/JDBC drivers support batching, or you can explicitly use a batching mechanism provided by your ORM or framework.

#### 4. Security Vulnerabilities
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/auth/LoginController.java` (Line 65):**
  - **Comment:** The `/login` endpoint directly returns user details, including sensitive information (e.g., `userId`, `email`, `role`), immediately upon successful authentication. While `password` isn't returned, returning the full `User` object might expose more data than necessary.
  - **Suggestion:** Create a dedicated DTO (e.g., `AuthResponseDTO`) for login responses that only contains necessary information like a JWT token and minimal user details (e.g., username, role). Avoid exposing internal IDs or potentially sensitive data if not strictly required by the client.

#### 5. Maintainability and Extensibility
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/notification/EmailNotificationService.java` (Line 80):**
  - **Comment:** The `sendEmail` method directly depends on `new SmtpClient()`. This creates a tight coupling to a concrete implementation, making it harder to test (`SmtpClient` needs to be mocked) and less flexible for changing email providers. This violates the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
  - **Suggestion:** Introduce an `EmailClient` interface and inject an implementation of it into `EmailNotificationService`. This promotes loose coupling and testability.
    ```java
    // Before: new SmtpClient() inside method
    // After:
    public class EmailNotificationService {
        private final EmailClient emailClient; // Injected dependency

        public EmailNotificationService(EmailClient emailClient) {
            this.emailClient = emailClient;
        }

        public void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body) {
            emailClient.send(to, subject, body);
        }
    }
    ```

#### 6. Testability and Testing
- **File: `src/test/java/com/example/auth/UserServiceTest.java` (New Test Needed):**
  - **Comment:** The PR adds robust email validation in `registerUser`. However, there are no specific unit tests to verify that `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown for various invalid email formats (e.g., "user@.com", "user@com.", "user", "user@com").
  - **Suggestion:** Add parameterized tests or multiple test cases to cover invalid email scenarios for the `registerUser` method.
    ```java
    @Test
    void registerUser_invalidEmailFormat_throwsIllegalArgumentException() {
        User invalidEmailUser = new User("test", "user@.com", "pass");
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> userService.registerUser(invalidEmailUser));
        // Add more invalid email test cases
    }
    ```

#### 7. Design Patterns and Architectural Considerations
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/reporting/ReportGenerator.java` (Line 50):**
  - **Comment:** The `generateReport` method contains large conditional blocks (`if-else if-else`) to handle different report types (PDF, CSV, Excel). This structure suggests a violation of the Open/Closed Principle and could be refactored using the Strategy Pattern.
  - **Suggestion:** Define a `ReportStrategy` interface (or an abstract class) with a `generate()` method, and create concrete implementations for `PdfReportStrategy`, `CsvReportStrategy`, etc. Use a factory or dependency injection to provide the correct strategy at runtime.

#### 8. Java 21 Specifics
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/async/TaskExecutorConfig.java` (Line 25):**
  - **Comment:** The use of `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` for the `taskExecutor` bean is an excellent and appropriate adoption of Java 21's Virtual Threads. This will significantly improve scalability for I/O-bound asynchronous tasks within the application.
  - **Suggestion:** Ensure that tasks submitted to this executor are primarily I/O-bound. For heavily CPU-bound tasks, traditional platform threads or a dedicated CPU-bound thread pool might still be more suitable to avoid pinning carrier threads. Document this consideration for future developers.
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/model/User.java` (Line 1-10):**
  - **Comment:** The `User` class is a simple data carrier with final fields, getters, and `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString`. This is a perfect candidate for a Java 16+ **Record** type, which would significantly reduce boilerplate and improve conciseness.
  - **Suggestion:** Refactor `User` into a record:
    ```java
    public record User(Long id, String username, String email, String passwordHash) {
        // Compact constructor or custom methods if needed
    }
    ```

#### 9. Immutability & Resource Management (Advanced)
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/data/DataStreamProcessor.java` (Line 90):**
  - **Comment:** The `getProcessedStream()` method returns a mutable `List<String>` which is an internal state variable. If external code modifies this list, it could lead to unexpected side effects or bugs elsewhere in the application.
  - **Suggestion:** Return an unmodifiable view of the list or a defensive copy to enforce immutability:
    ```java
    public List<String> getProcessedStream() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(processedStream); // Or List.copyOf(processedStream) in Java 10+
    }
    ```

#### 10. Error Handling & Resilience
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/external/PaymentGatewayClient.java` (Line 120):**
  - **Comment:** The `processPayment` method catches a generic `Exception` and logs it, then re-throws it. While logging is good, catching `Exception` is too broad and can mask specific issues. Furthermore, the `processPayment` method could benefit from a retry mechanism for transient network or service unavailability errors.
  - **Suggestion:** Catch more specific exceptions (e.g., `IOException`, `TimeoutException`) and consider implementing a retry logic (e.g., using Spring Retry or Resilience4j) for defined transient errors. For non-retryable errors, convert them into meaningful custom exceptions.

#### 11. Logging & Monitoring
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/auth/AuthenticationFilter.java` (Line 40):**
  - **Comment:** The filter logs the full HTTP request parameters, including potentially sensitive user credentials (e.g., password in form data) at `INFO` level. This is a security risk and should be avoided in production logs.
  - **Suggestion:** Redact or mask sensitive information from logs. Ensure that only non-sensitive or masked data is logged, especially at lower log levels. Consider auditing logs for sensitive data.

#### 12. API Design
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/api/UserController.java` (Line 30):**
  - **Comment:** The `GET /users/{id}` endpoint returns a `User` entity directly. While it works, standard API design often prefers to return a dedicated `UserResponseDTO` to control which fields are exposed and to decouple the API contract from the internal data model.
  - **Suggestion:** Introduce `UserResponseDTO` for API responses, projecting only the necessary fields.
    ```java
    // public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
    // Should be:
    @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
    public UserResponseDTO getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        User user = userService.findById(id);
        return UserResponseMapper.toDto(user); // Assuming a mapper
    }
    ```

#### 13. PR Summary (Overall Feedback):
Overall, this PR provides a solid foundation for user management. The adoption of Java 21 features is a strong positive, indicating a forward-thinking approach. The most critical areas for immediate attention are enhancing unit test coverage, particularly for the new validation logic and edge cases, and revisiting the logging practices for sensitive data. Implementing batching for audit logs would significantly improve performance. The design generally adheres to good practices, but some minor refactorings (e.g., mapper usage, dependency inversion for email) would further improve maintainability and testability.

#### 14. Code Layering
- **Comment:** As per current guidelines, detailed review of code layering was not explicitly requested for this PR. If architectural layering is a concern in future reviews, please specify the expected layer boundaries and dependencies.
- **Suggestion:** N/A (No specific suggestions given the current "not needed" status).

#### 15. Line-Specific Comments
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/util/StringUtils.java` (Line 15):**
  - **Comment:** The `isNotNullOrEmpty` method could be simplified and made more readable using `String.isBlank()` which checks for null, empty, or whitespace-only strings, available in Java 11+.
  - **Suggestion:**
    ```java
    public static boolean isNotNullOrEmpty(String text) {
        return !text.isBlank(); // Simpler and more comprehensive
    }
    ```
- **File: `src/main/java/com/example/auth/UserService.java` (Lines 60-63):**
  - **Comment:** This block of code duplicates the password hashing logic already present in the `AuthService`. Duplication can lead to inconsistencies if the hashing algorithm needs to be updated in the future.
  - **Suggestion:** Extract the password hashing logic into a shared utility method or a dedicated `PasswordHasher` service, and inject it where needed. This promotes the Single Responsibility Principle and improves maintainability.
